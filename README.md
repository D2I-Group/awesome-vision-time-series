### Contribution

Time series analysis has witnessed the inspiring development from traditional autoregressive models, deep learning models, to recent Transformers and Large Language Models (LLMs). Efforts in leveraging vision models for time series analysis have also been made along the way but are less visible to the community due to the predominant research on sequence modeling in this domain. However, the discrepancy between continuous time series and the discrete token space of LLMs, and the challenges in explicitly modeling the correlations of variates in multivariate time series have shifted some research attentions to the equally successful Large Vision Models (LVMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs). To fill the blank in the existing literature, this survey discusses the advantages of vision models over LLMs in time series analysis and provides a comprehensive and in-depth overview of the existing methods.

Taxonomy are proposed as a dual view of *Time Series to Image Transformation* and *Imaged Time Series Modeling*. For the former, primary methods for imaging UTS or MTS are described and remarked on their pros and cons. For the latter, the existing methods are classified by conventional vision models, Large Vision Models (LVMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs).

The overall structure of our survey follows the general process of applying vision models for time series analysis as delineated in Figure 1. Based on the proposed dual view taxonomy, primary imaging methods on time series in Figure 2 and imaged modelling solutions in Figure 3, are reviewed in this survey, followed by the discussion including pre- & post-processing involved in this framework and future directions in this promising field.
